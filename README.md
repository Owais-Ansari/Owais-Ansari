### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am Owaish. I currently work as AI Research Engineer at Airamatrix to solve digital histopathological problems using computer vision and deep learning algorithms.

Currently I am Working on two projects:
    - Prostate gleason grading:
          Prostate cancer is one of the deadliest cancers in men, seriously affecting peopleâ€™s life and health. Normal Prostate tissue consists of stroma             and regularly arranged glands. However, cancer tissue has epithelial cells that will replicate and destroy the regular arrangement of glandular             units. The Gleason Grading is one of the most reliable methods to quantify the invasiveness of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is divided into 5           categories and Gleason grading is the sum of the tumorâ€™s major and minor components (>5%). These patterns have been manually assigned by                   pathologists. This process is very time-consuming and affected by inter and intra-observer variability. The role is to develop and maintained an           automated Gleason grading system that will help pathologists in saving time and can overcome inter and intra-observer variability to provide a             better diagnosis.
    
    - Organ Identification:
         In histopathology, examination of animal tissue by pathologists forms a crucial part of preclinical drug toxicology. Automated identification of            animal anatomy is the first prerequisite for developing analytical solutions in medical images. However, spatial complexity and variability of              anatomy make the classification more challenging. In order to solve this problem, our team came up with a two stage classifier. In which at first          stage a low objective binary instance segmentation is used to learn the sets of shapes of animal anatomy then later a high-objective classfier is          used to classify each instance.
